# The above have to stay in that specific order

# The chars on the left of the "=" are not necessary;
# But they are there for ease-of-use and convenience

# Some Operating Systems or CLIs do not support colour.
# If your Operating System or CLI does not support colour,
# then set "Colour_Enabled" to "false".

# "Colour_FG" is set to true or false.
# If it is true, the colour will be applied to the Font (and black background);
# if it is false, the colour will be applied to the background (and black font).
# If "Colour_Enabled" is set to false; it does not matter what the value of
# "Colour_FG" is.
